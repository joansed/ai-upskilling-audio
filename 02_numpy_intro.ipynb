    "# Fasterer Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure Python is slow, for two reasons. First, it is an **interpreted language**, which is always less efficient than a compiled language. Second, Python was originally conceived to work on a single thread, to make programming easier. It has a **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**, which means that only one python instruction is carried out at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are easy ways to make Python code run **very fast**, circumventing these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Python is very good at interfacing with non-Python libraries. This means you can write fast, compiled code in Rust or C++, and then call it from Python. The compiled libraries are exempt from the GIL, meaning that they can do their own threading, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there are a couple forms of parallelism within Python which circumvent the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy (\"Numerical Python\") is a fast library for doing all kinds of numerical array operations in Python. It's written in an unholy combination of C++ and Fortran, but as a user, you never have to worry about that!\n",
    "\n",
    "The golden rule of Numpy is that using numpy operations on numpy arrays is going to be fast, but using Python operations will be slow. For example, iterating over a matrix with for loops is slow, but operating on a matrix with numpy operations is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example..."

Replace each centroid with a weighted average of the current centroid and the mean of the points assigned to the centroid.\n",

    "\n",
    "3) (Advanced!) When you have high-dimensional data, you need more centroids to represent the data. When you have lots of centroids, things slow down. What to do?? In *product quantization*, you break a vector into parts and apply k-means to each subvector. Then for any vector, it gets assigned a cluster for each sub-vector. Create a collection of centroids with shape `[K, P, N/P]`, and update your algorithm to train centroids for all of the sub-vectors. Try to stick to Numpy operations as much as possible!"
